This is the code used for seminar #NLP in Finance at the University of Zurich#, 24HS, lead by Prof. Dr. Martin Volk.

The project investigates how news are processed in open market volatility.
- It first compresses the open market volatility using VAE into meaningful latent representations
- Then a latent mapper was used to predict the representations of the volatility from the embeddings of overnight news headlines
- The codes, models, and the results are stored in corresponding folder
